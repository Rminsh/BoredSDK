BoredSDK is a cross-platform Swift framework to communicate with the [Bored api](https://www.boredapi.com/) . See their documentation for further details.



## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

#### Swift Package manager

Open Xcode, go to `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...` and add `https://github.com/Rminsh/BoredSDK` to your project.

Or add `.package(url: "https://github.com/Rminsh/BoredSDKr", from: "1.0.0")` to your `Package.swift` file



## Usage üõ†

For simple **activity** request:
```swift
import BoredSDK

let resource = ActivityResource()

let request = BoredSDK(resource: resource)
request.execute { result in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        let activity = try? result.get()
        /// Do something with activity data
        
    case .failure(.badNetworkingRequest):
        print("Network error (Bad request)")
        
    case .failure(.errorParse):
        print("Network error (Parse error")
        
    case .failure(.unexpectedError):
        print("Network error (Unexpected error")
    }
}
```
Or to request an **acitvity with filter**:

```swift
import BoredSDK

let resource = ActivityResource(
	type: ActivityType.charity.rawValue, // You can get all the acitivity types from `ActivityType`
    participants: "1",
    maxprice: "1.0"
)

let request = BoredSDK(resource: resource)
request.execute { result in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        let activity = try? result.get()
        /// Do something with activity data
        
    case .failure(.badNetworkingRequest):
        print("Network error (Bad request)")
        
    case .failure(.errorParse):
        print("Network error (Parse error")
        
    case .failure(.unexpectedError):
        print("Network error (Unexpected error")
    }
}
```
